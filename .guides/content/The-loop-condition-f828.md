One of the key things about a loop is that it always involves a decision.

In the Flode chart, you can see that the decision is `counter < 9`.

What this does is continues going round and round the loop **until the condition is false** at which point the loop terminates and the code executes onwards after the loop.

## The challenges
We will now reinforce the concept of loops with a series of challenges that will get a bit harder with each one. By the end, you have most of the tools you need to start on more challenging algorithms.
