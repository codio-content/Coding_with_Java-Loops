This Unit introduces you to the concept of loops using code.

They may look a little scary but you'll get the hang of them very quickly.

### A for loop
```javascript
for( ctr = 0, total = 0; ctr<=input0; ctr++) {
  total = total + ctr
  output(total)
}
```

### A while loop
```javascript
counter = 0
while ( counter <= 9) {
  console.log(counter)
  counter = counter + 1
}
```
