In the code on the left, you can see that we have three different versions of code that do the same thing.

We have put the `System.out.println(total);` into the end of loop stataments. You can run the code and see for yourself that it is the same.

{Run the code}(content/for_loop/For2.sh)

## So what is the difference?
The `for` and `while` loops are *functionally equivalent* and the only difference is which indicates the intention of the code better and which is likely to be better understood by another reader.

## Play
Feel free to hack the code around on the left. If you mess it up, reset it by the 'Reset Chapter' option in the Settings menu at the top of this page.
